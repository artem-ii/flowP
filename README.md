<h1>FlowP</h1>
<h3>FlowP is an R script for automatic transformation of flow cytometry data table exported from FlowJo into a nice looking report.</h3>

The ultimate goal is to create rmd report at a glance. For now separate export .svg plots and a .csv file with ANOVA and Pair-wise comparisons seems to work well.

* File pops.txt represents an input file, in which all the parameters for analysis are set.
